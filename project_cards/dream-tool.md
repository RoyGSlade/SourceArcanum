## One-liners

**Short Tagline (7-12 words):**
Lucid Dreaming Assistant and Whiteboard.

**Plain Description (1 sentence):**
An AI-powered thought organizer, whiteboard, and project commander that structures chaos into actionable steps for any creation.

**Flavor Description (1 sentence, myth tone):**
A digital staff for the modern wizard, summoning order from the chaos of the mind and manifesting thoughts into reality through the weave of code and image.

## Full Description

**1-2 Paragraphs:**
(What it does, who it's for, what makes it different)

Dream Tool is a "one-stop shop" for organizing thoughts and building *anything*—from a simple email to an entire ecosystem. It functions as a mind map, text editor, and whiteboard, but leverages open-source AI to act as a "commander" for your dreams. It doesn't just store ideas; it actively helps you plan, research, and execute them.

The tool features a hierarchy leveling system that adapts to the scale of your project. For quick tasks, it offers a rapid, low-level planning stage. For complex endeavors, it scales up to help you build universes, research continuously using local and web resources, and visualize concepts with image generation. It is the bridge between the ethereal thought and the concrete action.

## Feature List

**6-12 Bullet Features:**
- AI-Driven Project Planning & hierarchy API
- Infinite Whiteboard for Visualization
- Integrated Web & Local Research Agent
- Adaptive Project Scoping (Micro to Macro)
- Image Generation for Inspiration
- Text Editor & To-Do List Integration
- Mind Mapping & Data Charting
- Actionable Step Generation

**3 "Flagship" Features:**
1.  **Dream Commander:** An AI agent that breaks down abstract goals into concrete, actionable steps and to-do lists.
2.  **Adaptive Hierarchy:** Automatically scales the complexity of the workspace based on the project size—from 1-minute tasks to multi-year ecosystem builds.
3.  **Active Research Assistant:** Autonomously finds relevant information from the web or local files to support your specific creative task.

## Roadmap

**Next 3 Features (Near-term):**
1. Core Whiteboard Implementation
2. Basic Local LLM Integration
3. Task List Generation Logic

**Next 3 Features (Mid-term):**
1. Web Research Agent Capabilities
2. Image Generation Integration
3. Project Hierarchy Scaling System

**Long-term Direction (1 paragraph):**
The ultimate vision is to create a tool that feels like "pixie dust" for creation—removing all friction between having an idea and executing it. It will evolve into a fully autonomous partner that can not only plan but assist in the actual creation of assets, code, and content, effectively becoming a second brain that works while you sleep.
