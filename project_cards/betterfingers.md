(What it does, who it's for, what makes it different)

BetterFingers is an accessibility ecosystem designed to help people read documents and express themselves authentically. It doesn’t simply repeat text verbatim; instead, it refines it to achieve a formal, natural, or expressive feel, enabling users to quickly and efficiently convey their ideas without overthinking.

It also bridges the gap between controller use and rapid typing in chat, offering a significant speed advantage over traditional keyboard input, particularly for longer passages. Whether running on modest devices or high-performance machines, it adapts to your hardware with interchangeable models—giving you the flavor of a refined digital soul without the latency of the cloud.
