## Full Description

**1-2 Paragraphs:**
(What it does, who it's for, what makes it different)

*The Accountant* is a private wealth tracker designed to give you an uncompromising picture of your financial reality. It leverages local OCR and AI to ingest your bank statements, income, and subscriptions, organizing them into a clear, actionable dashboard. Unlike other finance apps, it is completely offline and private—it never touches the internet, ensuring your financial life remains yours alone.

More than just a tracker, it is a simulation engine. It allows you to propose scenarios to a local LLM—"What happens if I buy this car?", "How long to pay off this debt if I cancel these subscriptions?"—and receive reasoned probabilities and plans. It is built to communicate modularly with *Hobbies to Hundreds*, allowing for a holistic view of your wealth generation and preservation strategies without leaking data between them.
