## Full Description

(What it does, who it's for, what makes it different)

*Codex Forge* (Pdf Manager) is a pragmatic tool designed to break the chains of subscription-based PDF software. It is not meant to be a revolutionary overhaul of the file format, but a sovereign utility that lets you simply *work*. Whether you need to sign a document, add a field, or manipulate a page, this tool handles it locally and privately.

Its standout feature is the integration of local AI for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS). It can take dense research papers or scanned images and convert them into audio files overnight, allowing you to "read" complex documents while driving or commuting. It transforms static, locked data into accessible, portable knowledge.
