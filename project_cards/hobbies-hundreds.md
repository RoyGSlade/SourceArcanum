## Full Description

**1-2 Paragraphs:**
(What it does, who it's for, what makes it different)

HobbiesToHundreds is a concept dedicated to financial freedom through personal authenticity. Unlike generic business guides, it starts with *you*—taking what you already know and do, and mapping out a path to benefit from it financially. It acts as a deeply personal consultant, analyzing your interests—whether it's restoring furniture, thrifting, or content creation—and researching the viability of those paths specifically for you.

This is a "canon project" designed to be private, local, and free. It functions as a simulator for your potential futures, allowing you to "dreamscape" scenarios (e.g., "What if I started a YouTube channel?"). It provides structure, warns against overextension, and relates the success patterns of others directly to your unique position. It is designed to figure you out and find the answers that fit your life, requiring significant investment from both the user and the system to build a truly sovereign future.
