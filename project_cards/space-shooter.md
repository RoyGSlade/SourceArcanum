# Project Identity

**Real Name:** Stardust
**Codename:** Stardust
**Category:** Games
**Status (Machine):** archived
**Status Label (Display):** DRIFTING

## One-liners

**Short Tagline (7-12 words):**
Physics-based space racing and crystal collection demo.

**Plain Description (1 sentence):**
A speed-running tech demo where you pilot a ship with real physics to collect crystals and race against the clock.

**Flavor Description (1 sentence, myth tone):**
Dance through the void on the edge of drift, harvesting the crystallized light of dead stars before the darkness catches up.

## Full Description

**1-2 Paragraphs:**
(What it does, who it's for, what makes it different)

*Stardust* (formerly "Roadmap Game") is a study in momentum and mastery. It is currently a tech demo focused on high-speed traversal using real physics. Players must navigate asteroid fields, collect crystals, and manage their ship's drift to achieve the fastest times. 

While currently a solo experience, it serves as the foundation for a much larger vision: a chaotic, tag-team tactical shooter where piloting and systems management are split between two players. For now, it remains a testbed for flight mechanics and a challenge for those who enjoy the purity of time trials.

## Feature List

**6-12 Bullet Features:**
- **Physics-Based Flight:** Momentum, drift, and thrust mechanics.
- **Time Trial Mode:** Race against the clock for the best time.
- **Crystal Collection:** Precision flying targets.
- **Dynamic Asteroid Fields:** Procedural obstacles (planned).
- **Tech Demo Status:** A raw showcase of the engine's potential.
- **Browser Play:** Runs directly in the web browser.

**3 "Flagship" Features:**
1.  **Newtonian Flight Model:** Experience space travel where inertia is your best friend and worst enemy.
2.  **Speed-Run Focus:** Designed for mastery, where shaving milliseconds requires perfect execution.
3.  **Co-op Foundation:** The underlying engine built to eventually support split-role multi-crew ships.

## Roadmap

**Next 3 Features (Near-term):**
1. Leaderboard Integration (if server available)
2. Basic Ship Customization (Visuals)
3. Enhanced Level Design

**Next 3 Features (Mid-term):**
1. Multiplayer Port Forwarding Support
2. "Tag-Team" 2v2 Mode Prototype
3. 5-Level Campaign Structure

**Long-term Direction (1 paragraph):**
The ultimate vision is a 2v2 tactical arena shooter. Teams of two share a single ship: one player pilots, managing the physics and evasion, while the other acts as Gunner/Engineer, managing shields, weapons, and repairs. Teams fight through PVE levels to reach a final PVP arena, testing their coordination and communication in a high-stakes dogfight.
