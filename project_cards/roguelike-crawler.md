# Project Identity

**Real Name:** Roguelike Crawler
**Codename:** Iron Descent
**Category:** Games
**Status (Machine):** prototype
**Status Label (Display):** DESCENDING

## One-liners

**Short Tagline (7-12 words):**
A turn-based LLM-driven dungeon crawl demo.

**Plain Description (1 sentence):**
A one-shot, static page demo game showcasing the *Infinite Ages* rules and *Deep Stone* map generation, driven by a local LLM storyteller.

**Flavor Description (1 sentence, myth tone):**
A descent into a never-ending dark, where the world remembers your bones even as your new soul takes its first breath.

## Full Description

**1-2 Paragraphs:**
(What it does, who it's for, what makes it different)

*Iron Descent* is a "play pretend" engine—a piece of interactive entertainment designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the *Deep Stone* map creator and the *Infinite Ages* ruleset. It is a 2D top-down, turn-based roguelike where the dungeon master is a simple but elegant local LLM. It allows users to run through solo adventures with randomized loot and NPCs, experiencing the mechanics of the larger system in a contained, fun environment.

Currently, this project sits low on the priority list, serving as a reward for when the productivity tools are complete. It creates a space for pure enjoyment, testing the limits of what a browser-based, offline-first AI game can look like.

## Feature List

**6-12 Bullet Features:**
- **Local LLM Dungeon Master:** An AI that narrates and manages the adventure offline.
- **Infinite Ages Ruleset:** Runs on the same mechanics as the TTRPG.
- **Deep Stone Map Integration:** Uses maps generated by the *Deep Stone* tool.
- **Persistent World State:** The world remains and remembers previous runs/deaths.
- **Turn-Based Combat:** Classic tactical gameplay.
- **Randomized Loot & NPCs:** Endless variety in every run.
- **Static Page Architecture:** Runs entirely in the browser without complex backend requirements.

**3 "Flagship" Features:**
1.  **AI Story Mode:** A solo adventure guide that adapts the narrative to your actions using local intelligence.
2.  **Legacy World:** A "never-ending" open world where your new characters exist in the same continuity as your dead ones.
3.  **Tech Demo Synergy:** Acts as the playable proof-of-concept for both the *Deep Stone* map maker and *Infinite Ages* system.

## Roadmap

*(Note: This project is currently on the back burner. Features below are conceptual.)*

**Next 3 Features (Near-term):**
1. Basic Movement & Collision Logic
2. Simple Combat Loop Implementation
3. LLM Flavor Text Integration

**Next 3 Features (Mid-term):**
1. Inventory & Loot Tables
2. NPC Interaction System
3. Deep Stone Map Import

**Long-term Direction (1 paragraph):**
The vision is to build a massive, never-ending open world. When you die, you don't reset the world—you essentially respawn as a new character in the same history you helped create. It aims to be a "living" rogue-like where your past actions echo into your future runs.
