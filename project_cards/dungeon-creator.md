## One-liners

**Short Tagline (7-12 words):**
Automated 2D top-down map creator for worlds.

**Plain Description (1 sentence):**
A tool for rapidly generating coherent, multi-layered 2D top-down maps for TTRPGs and video games.

**Flavor Description (1 sentence, myth tone):**
Prompt worlds to play in—a forge for imagining at a higher level and manifesting your dreamscapes into playable realities.

## Full Description

**1-2 Paragraphs:**
(What it does, who it's for, what makes it different)

Deep Stone is an automated creator for 2D top-down maps, designed to let you "think out" your worldbuilding ideas. It goes beyond simple tile placement by offering a massive layered system—allowing for coherent structures with basements, floors, and subfloors. It serves as a rapid creation engine for TTRPG masters and game developers alike, giving them the tools to adjust, expand, and fine-tune the "vibe" of their world without painstakingly placing every pixel.

It allows you to import custom tile sets or works from artists and "transcribe" them into workable building blocks. The system learns from your critiques, refining its generation to match your personal style. It acts as a bridge between imagination and table-ready assets, and will eventually power the generation of environments for the *Infinite Ages* system.

## Feature List

**6-12 Bullet Features:**
- Multi-Layered Map Generation (Basements, Floors, etc.)
- Dynamic Object & Collision Placement
- Custom Tile Set "Transcription" & Training
- Style & Vibe Fine-Tuning
- Automated Coherence Checks
- Rapid 2D Top-Down Layouts
- Export to Common Formats (JSON/PNG)
- Local & Private Storage

**3 "Flagship" Features:**
1.  **Deep Layering System:** compile complex, multi-story structures (mansions, dungeons) into a single, coherent map file.
2.  **Tile Set Transcription:** Import external artist assets and automatically convert them into usable, intelligent tile logic.
3.  **Generative Critique Loop:** Train the generator by critiquing its outputs, refining it to produce maps that match your specific vision.

## Roadmap

**Next 3 Features (Near-term):**
1. Core Generation Algorithm Design
2. Basic Tile Set Import Logic
3. Layered Data Structure Definition

**Next 3 Features (Mid-term):**
1. UI for "Vibe" Adjustment
2. Collision & Object Metadata Support
3. Integration with *Infinite Ages*

**Long-term Direction (1 paragraph):**
Deep Stone aims to become a fundamental piece of the puzzle for digital tabletop experiences and indie game development. The goal is to create a private, offline-first tool that removes the tedium of mapping, allowing creators to focus on the story and the experience.
