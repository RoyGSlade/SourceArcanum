## Full Description

**1-2 Paragraphs:**
(What it does, who it's for, what makes it different)

*Infinite Ages Genesis* is a world simulation and narrative storytelling engine that breaks the mold of traditional TTRPGs. It is a completely classless system designed for player-driven and GM-driven storytelling, set within the vast "USSI" framework. This setting allows Game Masters to drop players into literally *any* world they can imagine—whether it's a grit-filled medieval planet, a sleek modern metropolis, a colonial frontier, or a chaotic sci-fi pirate flotilla—all while keeping the core mechanics consistent.

The system distinguishes itself with a unique "learning by doing" progression. Instead of arbitrary experience points, your character evolves through action. Utilize your "Artist" or "Athlete" skills, or engage in charisma-based diplomacy; success grants skill levels, which in turn drive your overall character level, PowerPoints, and HP. With 10 distinct superpowers featuring massive skill trees, a deep cybernetics system, comprehensive crafting, and a unique combat flow using a full 7-dice set (d20-d100), it offers a depth of play that is expansive yet manageable.

## Feature List

**6-12 Bullet Features:**
- **Classless Progression:** Build exactly the character you want without arbitrary restrictions.
- **Universal Setting (USSI):** Seamlessly transition between genres (Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Modern, Western).
- **Usage-Based Leveling:** Skills level up as you successfully use them, driving character growth organically.
- **Superpower Skill Trees:** 10 distinct power sets with massive, deep branching paths.
- **Cybernetics & Crafting:** Robust systems for augmenting characters and creating gear.
- **Unified Dice System:** Utilizes d20, d12, d10, d6, d4, and d100.
- **Dynamic Status Effects:** A complex status system that impacts gameplay meaningfully.
- **Beta Tested:** Hand-built and refined over years of actual play.

**3 "Flagship" Features:**
1.  **The USSI Framework:** A narrative device that justifies and enables infinite diversity in settings, allowing a single campaign to span across wildly different worlds and genres.
2.  **Organic Skill Evolution:** A progression system where your character becomes what they *do*. If you negotiate, you become a diplomat; if you fight, you become a warrior—no pre-selected paths required.
3.  **Superpower Integration:** A deep power system that integrates seamlessly with mundane skills, allowing for characters that blend magic, tech, and natural talent.

## Roadmap

**Next 3 Features (Near-term):**
1. **GM Guide:** A comprehensive manual for running operations in the USSI.
2. **Online Character Sheet:** A web-based, manageable sheet for tracking the complex stats and skill trees.
3. **Campaign Module:** A starter adventure to introduce players to the mechanics and setting.

**Next 3 Features (Mid-term):**
1. **GM Toolkit:** A suite of digital tools to assist in world generation and management.
2. **Local Session Notes:** A private, "Better Notes"-style application for taking campaign notes that stay ensuring no data leaks.
3. **Conclusive World Lore Book:** The definitive guide to the history and secrets of the Infinite Ages universe.

**Long-term Direction (1 paragraph):**
The ultimate horizon for *Infinite Ages* is the development of a proprietary Virtual Tabletop (VTT). Unlike commercial VTTs that lock data in the cloud, this will be a privacy-focused, self-hosted solution. It will allow GMs to host their own sessions directly from their machines (Direct Connect), ensuring that your campaigns, your worlds, and your stories remain yours alone. It represents the shift from just a book to a complete digital ecosystem for offline-first play.
